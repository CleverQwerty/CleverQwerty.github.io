     I look forward to studying with you in the library. That is the only time I actually like to study.
     Also the daily icecream tours to Rangoli keep me going. </p>

     Your stories are safe with me. I was going to put one here but then I felt its our personal thing and
     wouldn't look good on a public domain.

     Hope I actually get to work on a project with you this year. Weirdly, everytime I plan one, something or the
     other goes wrong. This year there weren't any real excuses so a pandemic hit the entire world. Like Wow!

  Really feel bad about cancelling on our daily virtual study sessions. But it isn't working for me.
  I'll make it up to you once we are back in Symbi.
